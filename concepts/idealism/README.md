# Idealism

Idealism is a philosophical position that holds that reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual in nature, or that ideas and mind are primary in understanding existence.

## Core Concept

Idealism asserts that the nature of reality is dependent on the mind or ideas. Unlike materialism, which holds that matter is the fundamental substance of all things, idealism maintains that consciousness, thought, or spirit is the foundation of reality.

## Types of Idealism

### Subjective Idealism (Immaterialism)
Associated with George Berkeley (1685-1753). Holds that objects only exist insofar as they are perceived by a mind. Berkeley's famous principle: "esse est percipi" (to be is to be perceived).

> "The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden... no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them."
> — George Berkeley, *A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge*, 1710

### Transcendental Idealism
Developed by Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Distinguishes between phenomena (things as they appear to us, structured by our cognitive faculties) and noumena (things-in-themselves, which are unknowable). Space, time, and causality are forms imposed by our mind, not features of reality itself.

> "Wir haben also sagen wollen: daß alle unsre Anschauung nichts als die Vorstellung von Erscheinung sei."
> (We have therefore wanted to say: that all our intuition is nothing but the representation of appearance.)
> — Immanuel Kant, *Kritik der reinen Vernunft* (Critique of Pure Reason), A250, 1781

### Absolute Idealism (German Idealism)
Developed by Hegel (1770-1831), building on Fichte and Schelling. Reality is the self-development of an absolute Spirit (Geist) through a dialectical process. The distinction between subject and object is ultimately overcome in the Absolute.

> "Das Wahre ist das Ganze."
> (The true is the whole.)
> — G.W.F. Hegel, *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (Phenomenology of Spirit), Preface, 1807

### Objective Idealism
Holds that ideas or ideals have an objective existence independent of individual minds. Associated with Plato's Theory of Forms, where abstract Forms (such as Beauty, Justice, Goodness) are more real than physical objects.

| **Materialism** | Matter is the fundamental substance; mind arises from matter | Democritus, Marx, modern physicalists |
| **Dualism** | Mind and matter are two distinct substances | Descartes |
| **Realism** | Objects exist independently of perception | Aristotle, Locke (empirical realism) |
| **Empiricism** | Knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience | Locke, Hume |
| **Rationalism** | Knowledge comes primarily from reason | Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza |
