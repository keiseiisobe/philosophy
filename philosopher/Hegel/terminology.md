# Hegel's Terminology

A glossary of key terms used in Hegel's philosophical works.

## Entstehen (German: entstehen)

Literally means "to arise" or "to come into being." In Hegel's philosophy, Entstehen refers to the process of emergence or origination—the moment when something new comes into existence out of a prior state. It is closely related to the dialectical movement where a new determination arises from the negation or contradiction of what preceded it. Entstehen is paired with Vergehen (passing away/ceasing to be), together forming the dynamic of Werden (becoming).

> "Werden ist das Entstehen und Vergehen" (Becoming is arising and passing away)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 1

## Aufheben (German: aufheben)

One of Hegel's most important and untranslatable terms. Aufheben has three simultaneous meanings: (1) to cancel or negate, (2) to preserve or keep, and (3) to lift up or elevate to a higher level. In the dialectical process, when a thesis and antithesis are aufgehoben in the synthesis, they are at once negated (their one-sidedness is overcome), preserved (their essential truth is retained), and elevated (they are brought to a higher, more comprehensive stage of understanding). This threefold meaning is central to understanding Hegel's dialectic.

> "Aufheben hat in der Sprache den gedoppelten Sinn, daß es soviel als aufbewahren, erhalten bedeutet und zugleich soviel als aufhören lassen, ein Ende machen."
> (To sublate has a twofold meaning in the language: on the one hand it means to preserve, to maintain, and equally it also means to cause to cease, to put an end to.)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 1

## Idee (German: die Idee)

The Idea is one of the most central concepts in Hegel's philosophy, representing the unity of the Concept (Begriff) and its realization—the complete adequation of thought and being. Unlike the everyday sense of "idea" as a subjective mental representation, Hegel's Idee is objective and absolute: it is truth itself, the fully actualized rational structure of reality. The Idea is the culmination of the entire logical development in Hegel's *Science of Logic*, where it emerges as the Absolute Idea—the self-thinking thought that comprehends itself and all its determinations. In Hegel's system, Nature and Spirit are manifestations of the Idea in its externality and return to itself.

> "Die Idee ist das Wahre an und für sich, die absolute Einheit des Begriffs und der Objektivität."
> (The Idea is the True in and for itself, the absolute unity of the Concept and objectivity.)
> — Hegel, *Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften* (Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences), §213, 1817

## Idealism (German: Idealismus)

In Hegel's philosophy, idealism does not mean that the external world is merely an illusion or exists only in our minds. Rather, Hegel's "absolute idealism" holds that reality is ultimately rational and that the structure of thought (the Idea) and the structure of being are identical. For Hegel, the finite world is real but not self-sufficient—it is a manifestation of the Absolute, the self-developing totality of reason. Hegel distinguishes his position from "subjective idealism" (Berkeley, Fichte) which reduces reality to individual consciousness, and develops what he calls "objective" or "absolute" idealism where Spirit (Geist) realizes itself through nature and history.

> "Was vernünftig ist, das ist wirklich; und was wirklich ist, das ist vernünftig."
> (What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational.)
> — Hegel, *Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts* (Elements of the Philosophy of Right), Preface, 1820

## Bestimmtheit (German: die Bestimmtheit)

Bestimmtheit means "determinateness" or "definiteness"—the quality by which something is what it is and not something else. In Hegel's *Science of Logic*, Bestimmtheit is fundamental to the movement from pure indeterminate Being (Sein) to determinate Being (Dasein). Pure Being, in its utter abstraction, lacks all Bestimmtheit and thus passes over into Nothing; it is only through acquiring determinateness that Being becomes something definite and real. Bestimmtheit is closely related to Bestimmung (determination, vocation) and negation: to be determinate is to be limited, to be this rather than that, which implies the negation of what it is not. For Hegel, all determinateness is negation (*omnis determinatio est negatio*), a principle he inherits and transforms from Spinoza.

> "Das Dasein ist bestimmtes Sein; seine Bestimmtheit ist seiende Bestimmtheit, Qualität."
> (Determinate being is determinate being; its determinateness is a determinateness that is, quality.)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 2

## Sein (German: das Sein)

Sein, "Being," is the absolute beginning of Hegel's *Science of Logic* and thus of his entire philosophical system. Hegel starts with pure Being—Being without any further determination, without any quality or content whatsoever. It is the most immediate and abstract thought possible: the thought of sheer "is" with nothing predicated of it. Yet precisely because pure Being is entirely indeterminate, it contains no distinction within itself; it is empty, and in its emptiness it is indistinguishable from Nothing (Nichts). This dialectical identity of Being and Nothing constitutes the first movement of the Logic: Being passes over into Nothing, Nothing passes over into Being, and their truth is Becoming (Werden)—the unity of their passing into one another. From this originary movement, all further categories of thought unfold.

> "Sein, reines Sein, — ohne alle weitere Bestimmung."
> (Being, pure being — without any further determination.)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 1

## Dies (German: dies / dieses)

Dies means "this" and is a pivotal term in Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit*, particularly in the opening chapter on sense-certainty (*Die sinnliche Gewißheit*). Sense-certainty claims to be the richest and most immediate form of knowledge—a direct apprehension of "this" particular thing, "here" and "now." Yet Hegel demonstrates that when we try to express this supposedly immediate knowledge, we find that "this," "here," and "now" are not particulars at all but universals. Any "this" can be replaced by another "this"; the word applies equally to anything we might point to. The sensuous "this" that was meant to be singular and concrete turns out to be the most abstract and empty of terms. This dialectical reversal—where the richest becomes the poorest, and the most immediate becomes the most mediated—initiates the phenomenological journey toward absolute knowing. The analysis of Dies reveals that language and thought are inherently universal, and that pure immediacy, when articulated, always already contains mediation.

> "Das Diese, das Hier und Jetzt, sind solche einfache, alle Bestimmung von sich ausschließende Unmittelbarkeit, die doch in sich selbst das Allgemeine ist."
> (The This, the Here and Now, are such simple immediacy excluding all determination from itself, which yet in itself is the universal.)
> — Hegel, *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (Phenomenology of Spirit), I. Sense-Certainty, 1807

## Dingheit (German: die Dingheit)

Dingheit means "thinghood" or "thing-ness"—the abstract universal nature of being a thing. In Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit*, Dingheit emerges in the chapter on perception (*Die Wahrnehmung*) as consciousness attempts to grasp the object as a thing with many properties. The problem that arises is how to understand the unity of the thing: is the thing merely a passive medium in which properties inhere, or is it an active "One" that excludes other things? Dingheit represents the attempt to think the universal nature of thinghood as such—what makes a thing a thing. Yet this concept proves unstable: the thing is supposed to be a self-identical unity, but it is also constituted by its many properties and its relations to other things. The thing's identity depends on its difference from others, and its unity dissolves into a plurality of properties. This dialectical tension drives consciousness beyond perception toward the understanding (*Verstand*) and the concept of force. Dingheit thus marks a crucial moment in the phenomenological development where the naive realism of perceiving independent things breaks down.

> "Die Dingheit selbst, oder die reine Wesentlichkeit, ist das allgemeine Medium, worin die vielen Eigenschaften als sinnliche Allgemeinheiten, jede für sich ist, und als bestimmte, andere von sich ausschließt."
> (Thinghood itself, or pure essentiality, is the universal medium in which the many properties as sensuous universalities, each for itself, exist and, as determinate, exclude others from themselves.)
> — Hegel, *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (Phenomenology of Spirit), II. Perception, 1807

## Eins (German: das Eins)

Eins, "the One," is a central category in Hegel's *Science of Logic*, emerging in the doctrine of Being as the culmination of quality. The One is Being-for-self (Fürsichsein) in its simple, immediate form—a self-related unity that excludes all otherness from itself. When Being becomes determinate and distinguishes itself from what it is not, and then relates this negation back to itself, it becomes the One: a self-enclosed, indivisible unit. The One is thus the first true individual—the logical form of atomicity and discreteness. Yet the One's very self-exclusion implies the existence of other Ones; in repelling otherness, it posits the Many (die Vielen). This dialectic of the One and the Many—where each One both repels and attracts others—leads to Repulsion (Repulsion) and Attraction (Attraktion), and ultimately to the transition from Quality to Quantity. In the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, the One appears in the analysis of perception, where the thing is grasped as a One that possesses many properties while excluding other things. The concept of the One thus bridges the abstract logical sphere and the phenomenological encounter with objects.

> "Das Eins ist die einfache Beziehung des Fürsichseins auf sich selbst, in der seine Momente in sich zusammengefallen sind, in der es daher die Form der Unmittelbarkeit hat."
> (The One is the simple self-relation of being-for-self, in which its moments have collapsed into themselves, in which it therefore has the form of immediacy.)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 3

## Wahrheit (German: die Wahrheit)

Wahrheit, "truth," has a distinctive meaning in Hegel's philosophy that differs significantly from the ordinary correspondence theory where truth is the agreement of a statement with external facts. For Hegel, truth is the agreement of a content with itself—the adequation of a thing's concept (Begriff) with its actuality (Wirklichkeit). Something is true when it fully realizes what it essentially is, when its existence corresponds to its concept. In this sense, we speak of a "true friend" or a "true work of art"—one that fully embodies what friendship or art ought to be. Philosophically, Wahrheit names the result of dialectical development: each category or shape of consciousness reveals its own inadequacy and passes over into a higher form that is its "truth." Thus Hegel says that Becoming is the truth of Being and Nothing, that the Idea is the truth of the Concept, and that Absolute Knowing is the truth of all preceding shapes of Spirit. Truth is not a static property but the dynamic self-unfolding of the Absolute, the whole that comprehends all its moments. The famous claim that "the True is the whole" (*das Wahre ist das Ganze*) expresses this: truth is not found in isolated propositions but in the complete systematic development of thought and reality.

> "Das Wahre ist das Ganze. Das Ganze aber ist nur das durch seine Entwicklung sich vollendende Wesen."
> (The True is the whole. But the whole is nothing other than the essence consummating itself through its development.)
> — Hegel, *Phänomenologie des Geistes* (Phenomenology of Spirit), Preface, 1807
