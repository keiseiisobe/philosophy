# Hegel's Terminology

A glossary of key terms used in Hegel's philosophical works.

## Entstehen (German: entstehen)

Literally means "to arise" or "to come into being." In Hegel's philosophy, Entstehen refers to the process of emergence or origination—the moment when something new comes into existence out of a prior state. It is closely related to the dialectical movement where a new determination arises from the negation or contradiction of what preceded it. Entstehen is paired with Vergehen (passing away/ceasing to be), together forming the dynamic of Werden (becoming).

> "Werden ist das Entstehen und Vergehen" (Becoming is arising and passing away)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 1

## Aufheben (German: aufheben)

One of Hegel's most important and untranslatable terms. Aufheben has three simultaneous meanings: (1) to cancel or negate, (2) to preserve or keep, and (3) to lift up or elevate to a higher level. In the dialectical process, when a thesis and antithesis are aufgehoben in the synthesis, they are at once negated (their one-sidedness is overcome), preserved (their essential truth is retained), and elevated (they are brought to a higher, more comprehensive stage of understanding). This threefold meaning is central to understanding Hegel's dialectic.

> "Aufheben hat in der Sprache den gedoppelten Sinn, daß es soviel als aufbewahren, erhalten bedeutet und zugleich soviel als aufhören lassen, ein Ende machen."
> (To sublate has a twofold meaning in the language: on the one hand it means to preserve, to maintain, and equally it also means to cause to cease, to put an end to.)
> — Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik* (Science of Logic), Book I, Section 1, Chapter 1

## Idealism (German: Idealismus)

In Hegel's philosophy, idealism does not mean that the external world is merely an illusion or exists only in our minds. Rather, Hegel's "absolute idealism" holds that reality is ultimately rational and that the structure of thought (the Idea) and the structure of being are identical. For Hegel, the finite world is real but not self-sufficient—it is a manifestation of the Absolute, the self-developing totality of reason. Hegel distinguishes his position from "subjective idealism" (Berkeley, Fichte) which reduces reality to individual consciousness, and develops what he calls "objective" or "absolute" idealism where Spirit (Geist) realizes itself through nature and history.

> "Was vernünftig ist, das ist wirklich; und was wirklich ist, das ist vernünftig."
> (What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational.)
> — Hegel, *Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts* (Elements of the Philosophy of Right), Preface, 1820
